#Dome.py

The script is intented to create the dome shape procedurally and to place the object in the correct position within the scene. It also performs a final cleanup of the manipulations that occurred in order to keep the outline and maya history clean and readable.

Since the dome shape present a spiral pattern on its surface, a script can easily produce that effect and can avoid tedious work of having to manipulate by hand each horizontal edge loop.

The script is only run once to produce the two dome in the scene. On top of that other operation has been manually added to the domes, such as applying texture and colours.

The script is located in the `script` folder of the project.
