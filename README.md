#Dome.py

Run `dome.py` to create the dome shape procedurally and to place the object in the correct position within the scene.

The script is located in the `script` folder of the project.

The script does the following things:

* it produces two domes inside the scene in a run.
* it places them in the right position.
* it performs a final cleanup of the manipulations that occurred in order to keep the outline and maya history clean and readable.

##Motivation

Since the dome shape present a spiral pattern on its surface, a script can easily produce that effect and can avoid tedious work of having to manipulate by hand each horizontal edge loop.
